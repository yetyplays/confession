                         Good morning, I just want to thank you for your time and for staying up late. I'm also sorry if I disregarded your feelings, but that wasn't my point; I just used the wrong words. I'm really sorry, I made a mistake and went too far. Thank you for being honest with me. Don't think about us for now because I'm just here, and while I'm waiting for you, I will also work on myself. Focus on yourself and your family while enjoying. So if the Lord grants us to be together, we will both be ready. Kapag handa kana (spaghetti ako) char, nandito lang ako para makinig sayo.
                        </p>
