                         Good morning, thank you for earlier for clarifying all things. I really appreciated it a lot, and I have never experienced anything like that before, whatever it may be called. I'm so happy that I experienced it. Just always remember, I'm always here for you. I know you have many problems, and I know you can handle them. Remember that I will always be in your life, whether in joy or sorrow. Thank you again for this new day, and I don't know if the Lord will grant you to me, but as long as He allows me to prove myself, I will make sure to do my best.
                        </p>
