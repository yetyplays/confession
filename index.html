                        Good morning, Love. Thank you for always sharing stories with me. I know you're pressured at work and don't want to talk about it, but I'm grateful because somehow, I can help reduce your stress. Tomorrow, if you're not busy, let's watch something together on Messenger Watch Together if that's okay with you. Thank you again for another day. Take care always; I'm here to listen to you.
                        </p>
