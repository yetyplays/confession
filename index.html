                         Good morning, I just want you to be open with me if that's okay with you because I feel like you're avoiding me. I just want you to be transparent with me, but if you're not comfortable, it's alright. I'm here for you. Thank you also for updating me even though you're busy. I really appreciate it because I haven't experienced that before. Don't worry, I won't waste this opportunity that you're giving me every day.
                        </p>
