                          Sure, here's your message translated into English:

---

Yes, I am ready, but not for commitment just yet. I'm ready to get to know you better and introduce myself properly. I'm not in a hurry, but I just want to clarify that I really like you. If you don't see me as someone who could be your last, just let me know. But for now, let me introduce myself to you.
                        </p>
