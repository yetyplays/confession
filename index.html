                         Good morning, Love. Thank you for coming with me to the party room earlier. You're really great at singing, and I'm still thrilled about it. I'm really happy that you joined me and even stayed late into the night. Your effort is incredible, and it makes me even more excited. Thank you again for giving me another day to prove myself.
                        </p>
