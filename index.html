                         Good morning, I hope you're feeling better and try not to move too much so your abdomen doesn't hurt as much. Right now, I don't know what to say, but do what makes you happy. I just want you to know that I'm here for you and do what helps you find peace of mind. Let's leave everything up to the Lord to see if it will work out for us. Thank you for another day that you allow me to show who I am.
                        </p>
