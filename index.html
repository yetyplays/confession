                         Good morning, I hope you start feeling better soon. Don’t pressure yourself too much because I know you can get through this. Take care of yourself because if your body gives in, it will be harder for you. If you don’t take care of yourself, I might have to take care of you. Always be careful, and remember that I’m here for you, waiting. Don’t think too much about your ex because I’m here now. Even though I may not be able to surpass what they did for you, I will do everything to give you what you deserve.   .
                        </p>
