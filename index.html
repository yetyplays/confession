                         Good morning, thank you for sharing everything that happened throughout your day. I really appreciate it. I didn't say anything earlier because I didn't want to interrupt your momentum while you were telling your story. By the way, please take care of yourself. I know you're tired, but you need to eat because it's hard if you get sick and no one can take care of you. Take care always, I'm always here, ready to listen and wait.
                        </p>
