                           Good morning, Love. I know we have an argument lately, thank you for communicating with me kahit pagod ka and madaming iniisip. I really appreciate it. I hope na maging okay na tayo. All your reasons are valid, and hindi ko ini-invalidate lahat ng sinabi mo. Wag mo isiping defensive, dramatic and nagiging OA ka, I know you're having a hard time and all your feelings are valid, wag ka matakot makipag communicate with just tell me everything na gumugulo sa utak mo.  I know you're stressed and pressured because of work, so don’t force yourself; progress is enough for me. I hope we can work this out together, not only you or me. We are going to support each other. If you have a problem with me or are thinking about my actions, just tell me so I know how to address the misunderstanding between us. Thank you for everything, and don't be afraid of explaining your side, okay? We can fix all the things in front of us basta i-communicate natin yun sa isa’t isa. Don’t be scared na baka hindi ko maintindihan; just tell me and elaborate everything para maintindihan ko. I'm aware that we can't change like in a snap but let's take it slowly, we don't need to rush things for us
